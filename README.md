# CERTest

Welcome to the homepage of CERTest, the first effort leveraging the mutation configurations and the furthest-first based selection strategy to validate the error recovery support of compilers.

## Requirments

We recommend using CONDA to configure your environment

* python 3.12
``` bash
pip install sklearn,pyclustering,libclang
```

* compiler 

``` bash
apt install clang-10 gcc-11
```

## Usage

Before running CERTest, we need to save the collected cpp files in the /yarpgen-programs folder in the project to ensure that these cpp files can be correctly found when the subsequent code is run.

Building ``yarpgen`` is trivial. All you have to do is to use cmake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Using following command to perform compiler testing!

```bash
python main.py
```

The experimental results will be saved in the compilation folder of the project, and the files generated by the mutation will be saved in the mutatefile folder. These two folders do not need to be created manually.
